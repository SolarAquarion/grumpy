{"name":"GrumpyChat","tagline":"IRC client based on pidgeonclient, written in C++","body":"### Welcome to GrumpyChat\r\nGrumpy is a very advanced IRC client. It takes the best out of every major IRC\r\nclient and leaves out the bad. It's designed for old school IRC users who need\r\nto be able to take most out of IRC.\r\n\r\nSome features:\r\n\r\n* Written in C++ (Qt) portable to every major platform\r\n* Distributed core (grumpyd) similar to Quassel IRC\r\n* Modular design, you can take the core library\r\n  and build a different interface on top of it\r\n* Very scalable and extendable\r\n* Support all IRC standards and networks\r\n* Supports IRCv3 protocol (http://ircv3.net/)\r\n* Extensible and very powerfull auto-completion mechanism\r\n\r\n## How to build\r\n\r\nYou need to have CMake in order to build grumpy in most easy way. If you have it\r\njust use it for src folder.\r\n\r\nGrumpy requires Qt4 or Qt5. It doesn't depend on any other libraries, except for\r\nits own libraries and sqlite, which are all embedded within the project tree.\r\n\r\nNote: sqlite source codes are gzipped. If you enable support for sqlite you will\r\n      need to unzip them or download fresh version.\r\n\r\nThere may also be information specific for your platform on our github wiki\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe source code is licensed under GNU LGPL, but contains some other embedded\r\nopen source libraries, such as sqlite which may have difference licenses.\r\n\r\nPlease see local README's or check headers of source code files for more\r\ninformation on license for a given file.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrumpy is currently a work in progress and is unfinished. Use on your own risk.\r\nThere is no manual yet. You can ask for help at #grumpy on network\r\nirc.tm-irc.org\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
