GrumpyChat is divided to 2 parts

lib
********
Contains all code of the GrumpyChat client, compiled as a library. That is necessary for extensions to work, since extensions
need to be linked against the client itself so that they can connect and alter its interface.

bin
********
Simple library wrapper which only contains the entry point to start the program, which is actually located in library
